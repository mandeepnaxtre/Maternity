You might experience breast changes, including areola darkening, soreness, and swelling.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Frequent urination happens when your bladder pushes on your developing uterus. By leaning forward while urinating, you can reduce the frequency of bathroom trips and ensure that your bladder is fully cleared every time.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Morning sickness is another symptom. The reason for this is a rise in the pregnancy hormone, hCG. Anytime during the day, it can happen. See your doctor if vomiting makes it difficult for you to eat.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This week, your baby's mouth, ears, and nose begin to form. Your baby's heart isn't fully developed, but its heart tube is beating fast, about 160 times a minute. Baby's intestines and lungs are also developing this week.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Immunity During Pregnancy</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The immune system often weakens during pregnancy, especially from weeks 6 to 8, when most of your baby's organs are still developing.</span></p> <ul> <li><strong><span style='font-weight: 400;'>To boost your immune system, eat a healthy diet and take daily vitamins according to instructions by your doctor.&nbsp;</span></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Look for medication that contains vitamin C, which boosts immunity.</span></li> </ul> <ul> <li><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Maintain a light exercise routine, but don't forget to get enough sleep as well, both can help to reduce stress and strengthen immunity.</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Week 6 Care Tips | Toxicosis</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Most of the time, pregnancy nausea and vomiting are called pregnancy vomiting or even toxicosis. It is not a widely used reference for pregnancy's early symptoms.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>By definition, toxicosis is a poisoning-related condition. However, medical professionals avoid using this word because it can be misleading. Certain foods may naturally make your body react negatively to them, marking them as 'poisons.' Your body uses this natural process to alert you when any medicines are unnecessary. Even your unborn child might get harmed by some of these.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Remember that the next time you vomit, it's your body trying to get rid of anything it doesn't want.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>To avoid such things, Eat little but often, get lots of rest, be aware of the risk of UTIs, and avoid coloring your hair. Contact your doctor if you are unable to consume any food or liquids for six hours.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Take Healthy Diet</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Eating well during pregnancy is key for an easy and happy delivery! But during this week, things could get a little complicated because simply thinking of an egg, a chicken, or any other food high in protein from poultry could make you feel nauseous or even vomit. So, you should consider </span><strong>Zinc</strong><span style='font-weight: 400;'>.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Zinc is necessary during pregnancy because it impacts cell formation. Zinc ensures rapid and strong development for your baby, since they begin as a little ball of cells.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Zinc also boosts quicker wound healing and strengthens immunity. It promotes weight gain and improves the way your baby's sense system develops. Your kid could be at risk for certain infections that you get because of low zinc levels.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The food items contain zinc:</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- beans,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- nuts;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- whole grains,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- cereals;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- dairy;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- red meats,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- poultry,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- oysters.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Eat the meals you enjoy, and don't force yourself to consume anything. Your body can reject it, and you might be unable to keep it within.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Things to Avoid</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Smoking has severe negative health effects. When smoke circulates from the placenta to the unborn child during pregnancy, the danger increases. Smoking has been linked to miscarriage, stillbirth, placental abruption, preeclampsia, abrupt newborn death, pediatric malignancies, and behavioral issues.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>There isn't a single acceptable quantity of cigarettes to smoke. It's perfect to stop smoking now if you smoke.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Avoid Caffeine</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Caffeine should be avoided during pregnancy because it can pass the placenta and impact fetal growth. Risks include low birth weight, premature birth, and developmental problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Avoiding caffeine during pregnancy can help produce better results.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Help your baby to be healthy by avoiding such things!</span></p>"

You are feeling bloated (puffy) at this time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Reduced blood sugar can lead to headaches, which increase symptoms of nausea and vomiting, especially during the first trimester.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your breasts will also appear to grow slightly, and as your pregnancy goes on, the bluish veins will show more clearly. This will get you ready for the important duty of breastfeeding your child.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Moreover, you might notice that your nails are growing faster and your hair becomes thicker. This is because of the estrogen hormone and the nutrients you get from food and supplements.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Ways to Stop Bloating</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Changing your diet can help with digestive problems, including snorting and bloating. Avoid eating late at night and try to cook six small meals each day.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Drink plenty of water, eat slowly, and avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. After eating, have a little walk. Some individuals find their bloating increase after consuming coffee or rich, fatty, and spicy foods. So, avoid consuming such things.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Protein at Week 10</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Protein is the nutrient that both you and the baby's cells require to grow. During pregnancy, you should consume sufficient protein, especially during the second and third trimesters when the baby is growing quickly.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Protein boosts the immune system, helps in the healing of infections, and gives new mothers energy. In order to prevent diabetes, a high-protein diet also maintains blood sugar.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>Eat the following to get adequate protein:</em></strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Soybeans and tofu&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Nuts and seeds</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Pasteurized milk</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Cheese, and yogurt</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Eggs</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Lean meats</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Poultry, and fish</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Yoga</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Both yoga and meditation can help you maintain your body's flexibility and control your blood pressure. By doing this, you feel calm and sleep well.</span></p> <p><strong>Yoga helps you to:-</strong></p> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Connect with your feelings</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Stay focused</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Connect with your child</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Feel better about the way your body is changing.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Feel peaceful and at ease</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Mentally get ready for birth and beyond.</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

      "<h2><strong>Your Pregnancy at Week 11</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>During week 11 of pregnancy,&nbsp; you're in month 3 of your pregnancy. Your body has seen changes such as a rounder structure and more sensitive breasts, etc. You can experience more cravings for food as your morning sickness begins to fade.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>At this time, you could feel so exhausted that all you want to do is lie down and go to sleep. Rest as much as you can; your body is working hard to take care of your growing child.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Now, your baby&rsquo;s cute facial development continues and the heart is fully formed.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Tips for Care of Your Skin</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>During pregnancy, the skin stretches so much that stretch marks appear. They usually appear in areas of fat such as the arms, breasts, thighs, hips, and belly.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Is there any way to avoid stretch marks? Yes, here are some ways</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Staying hydrated</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>A stretch mark is caused by moisture loss in the skin. So, you should restore the moisture loss. Apply essential oils to the afflicted areas regularly. Sunflower, almond, argan, or avocado oils are found in most goods.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Avoid scratching</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The skin may itch because of stretching. Do not scratch it, especially if the skin looks dark. Wear cotton clothing in place of wool, and apply extra oil to itchy areas.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Use anti-stretch mark products</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Don't stress out if you have stretch marks. Anti-stretch mark solutions can keep your skin flexible. Use them frequently, after delivery and during pregnancy. The marks may fade more quickly.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Nails and Hair During Pregnancy</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Did you not cut your fingernails two days ago? Does it seem like you have thicker hair than usual? It is obvious that the growth of your nails and hair is very fast. Why? Hormones involved in pregnancy!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>During pregnancy, estrogen levels rise. This boosts nail growth and changes the texture of hair. Pregnancy's effects on metabolism and increased blood circulation supply the skin and connective tissues with extra nutrients.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Are you unhappy about the swelling in your hands when you are pregnant? You will at least have gorgeous nails!</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Thiamine</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Thiamin, or vitamin B1, is an essential element to have all over pregnancy. It helps create fat and enables the normal functioning of amino acids.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Thiamin also controls the neurological system. A lack of vitamin B1 causes muscle weakness, fatigue, and nausea. When thiamin is present, tissues and cells have more energy, which is why this vitamin is crucial for pregnant women.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong><em>Eat the following to get adequate thiamin:-</em></strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Whole grains,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- rice, pasta,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- beans,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- almonds,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- berries,&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- and fortified foods (Sunflower seeds, Yogurt etc)</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Shopping Advice!</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Being pregnant does not mean you cannot be fashionable. So, Let&rsquo;s do some shopping. Buy good, stretchy bras, maternity clothes, and stretchy pants, preferably in cotton. Buy vitamins and dietary supplements that your doctor recommends. Buy cozy shoes that will reduce swelling and cramping in the legs.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The good news is that a healthy diet and comfortable clothes can go a long way toward ensuring comfort and maintaining a nutritious diet.<br /><br /></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

So, how do you feel that you are only several days away from the second trimester?</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your uterus is now about the size of a big grapefruit and is beginning to grow from the base of your pelvis to the front of your belly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>At week 13, vaginal discharge increases. A thin, milky, mild-smelling discharge is normal during pregnancy. Vaginal discharge helps maintain good bacteria in the birth canal and protects it from infection.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You may experience dizziness this week. As progesterone increases blood flow to your baby, it decreases your own blood flow to your brain, leading to fainting spells. That's great for your baby, but not so great for you.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Low blood-sugar levels may cause dizziness if you're not eating regularly. So eat more frequently. If you feel dizzy, sit down right away, or lie down on the left side.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Having Twins?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Are you expecting twins? Maybe especially if you're older than 35 or if there is a family history of fraternal twins.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><strong><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Finding out if you are pregnant with twins is only possible with an ultrasound scan.</span></strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Compared to a single pregnancy, physical changes during a twin pregnancy are more noticeable.</span></li> </ul> <ul> <li><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Pregnancy health issues and complications are more common in women carrying twins.</span></li> </ul> <ul> <li><span style='font-weight: 400;'>For twin pregnancies, extra prenatal care, hospital delivery, good dietary guidance, and specialized medical attention are advised.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Consult your practitioner at your next appointment to find out what's actually going on in there. You might actually have two babies in your womb, who knows?</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Ultrasound at Week 13</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Most pregnant women can get their first ultrasound this week. It's exciting to see your baby for the first time!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Transabdominal ultrasound requires a full bladder to visualize the baby properly. An ultrasound transabdominal uses gel on your belly and abdomen to capture detailed images of your baby and your womb.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>During the ultrasound, we'll measure your baby and listen to his heartbeat. A fast, galloping heartbeat is definitely music to your ears!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You will receive a copy of the first ultrasound report after the ultrasound. Remember to share your baby's first picture with your loved ones!</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Colostrum</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You'll notice that your breasts become bigger and more sensitive as the first trimester comes to an end. The areas can get darker, and the bluish veins become more visible.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Breast milk is starting to form, one of the biggest changes this week. Colostrum leaks during this time, but you don't have to worry about it!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Colostrum leaks contain a sticky yellowish-colored liquid. You can notice increased colostrum leakage around the end of your pregnancy. For now, simply focus on eating well so that when the time comes to start nursing, you will have enough milk to produce.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Remember that pregnancy can make you prone to infections, so you must be more careful about food hygiene. Whether you go to a restaurant or get street food, check that you're eating from a clean place!</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

Every woman is distinctive, but if the nausea is gone, your breasts feel less sensitive, and you don't need to use the restroom frequently at night, you are fortunate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Some uncomfortable symptoms may still be present, including constipation, mild foot swelling, and dizziness. However, these are easily controlled by adequate sleep, maintaining a high-fiber, low-salt diet, and engaging in frequent exercise.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><strong>Nosebleeds</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Nasal congestion and bleeding are common during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones increase blood flow to the tissue lining your nose, which is why it is happening.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Blowing your nose softly, one nostril at a time will help prevent nosebleeds. Avoid picking your nose. Maintaining sufficient moisture in the nasal passages is important. Consume protein and vitamin C, as these are excellent for healing wounds.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your nose will start to lose blood as you lean forward. You will get blood in your nose if you lean back. Avoid this.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Using your thumb, shut one nostril, then gently exhale through the other. Till you can breathe normally again, just repeat the process with the other nostril.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class='demoTitle'>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Pregnancy-related Acne</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The most adverse pregnancy symptom is acne. Though they may appear on the back and chest, they usually appear on the face. Remember, progesterone promotes oil release, which is why you have pimples. The good news is that after pregnancy, acne will go away.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Regretfully, while your hormones are running wild, you are unable to stop these changes. To treat acne, you can try these suggestions:</span></p> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Read the labels to ensure your skin care products are water-based rather than oil-based. There is no need for the additional oil on your skin.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>When you go outside, sunscreen is your best buddy. Acne is worse when exposed to sunlight. Before using the product, try the patch on your wrist to ensure that there won't be any allergic reactions.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Squeezing your pimples will only make them worse. If you cannot resist, try using a light toner as part of your skincare routine.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <p class='demoTitle'>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Tooth Care Tips</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Pregnancy-related hormonal changes might cause your gums to swell and collect food particles. Reducing dental issues doesn't need much, especially because needless dental procedures usually go off until after childbirth.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Medical professionals recommend brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day and every day. Mouthwashes without alcohol or washing with water can also be helpful if you have morning sickness.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>If immediate dental care is required, such as a root canal or tooth extraction, the least dose of local anesthetic is given. After the procedure, painkillers and antibiotics that are safe to take during pregnancy are provided.&nbsp;</span></p> <p class='demoTitle'>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What to Eat?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Food choices during the 15th week of pregnancy should be varied and full of nutrients. You should eat a rainbow of foods during your entire pregnancy, meaning a food variant with every rainbow color. It includes Beetroots, green leafy vegetables, proteins, calcium-rich foods, etc.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>If you often get food cravings, keep some fruits available. Healthy snack choices include nuts and yogurt. Eat folic acid-rich foods to help avoid birth defects and oily fish varieties high in omega-3 fatty acids. You should also include milk and milk products in your diet because bone strength is important.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Eggs are a good source of DHA and omega-3 fatty acids. Eggs are also essential for your rapidly growing baby and help develop your baby's brain and healthy nervous system.</span></p> <p class='demoTitle'>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>In a day, how many eggs can you eat?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Generally speaking, consuming no more than two eggs daily is OK, although this will vary based on your health, including your cholesterol levels. If you are overweight or watching your fat intake, cut down on the yolk part to three servings a week.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Just remember, eating a healthy and balanced diet is crucial before and after pregnancy!</span></p>"

Also, </span><span style='font-weight: 400;'>consider speaking with a genetic counselor both before and after the procedure to fully understand the implications of the test results.</span></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Kegel exercises are Key</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The human body is amazing at supporting life for nine months and even more wonderful at allowing one or two babies to emerge and finally enjoy the beauty of the outside world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>The skin or muscles around your vagina may tear during delivery. Kegel exercises are a good way to avoid or reduce this. Despite being silly, they really do have a great effect&mdash;especially if done correctly and promptly.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What are Kegel Exercises?</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This type of exercise was created by Dr. Kegel to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles by contracting and relaxing them. These exercises help improve bladder control and support pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Regular practice can lead to better pelvic health.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>When to start Kegels?</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>As soon as you can! Because strengthening your pelvic muscles will take some time, the earlier, the better. Kegel exercises are beneficial to women even if they are not pregnant because they improve sexual function.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How to perform Kegels at week 16?</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>At week 16, perform Kegels by identifying your pelvic floor muscles (the ones you use to stop urination). Contract these muscles for 5 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds. Repeat 10-15 times, three times a day, for best results, or you can do as much as you can!</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Hair Care Tips</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Have you been dying your hair a good color? It's true that enjoying yourself to the fullest during pregnancy is a wonderful thing. Even though basic hair treatments are usually safe, certain things must be considered to ensure your baby isn't at risk.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>When getting your hair dyed, remember these tips:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- wear gloves at all times;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- don't leave the dye on longer than is required;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- wash your scalp thoroughly after the treatment;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- Prevent breathing the chemicals by keeping the room well-ventilated;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Hormonal changes can result in the following:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- dye results have an uneven or strange color;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- permanents don't function or work unevenly.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Highlights and streaks&mdash;hair treatments that don't touch the scalp&mdash;are typically the most advised for pregnant women. Touch-ups to the roots enter the pores more quickly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What to Eat?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>As pregnancy continues, the mother and baby have increased nutritional requirements. Omega-3 fatty acids are one important nutrient that needs to be consumed to ensure that your baby's brain, eyes, nerves, and immune system develop normally.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Natural sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish. Try these if you're a vegetarian:</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- eggs;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- soybeans;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- tofu;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- walnuts;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- leafy green vegetables;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- canola oil;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- sesame seeds.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>To help fill in nutritional gaps, you can also take Omega-3 supplements, which are sometimes incorporated into your daily prenatal vitamin.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Week 16 is an exciting time filled with growth and anticipation. Remember to take care of yourself, cherish these moments, and look forward to the incredible journey ahead. Your baby is growing rapidly, and every day brings you closer to meeting your little one. Enjoy this beautiful phase of your pregnancy!</span></p>"

      "<h2><strong>Maternity Application (Week 17) Mother</strong></h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What Happened in Week 17?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Welcome mom-to-be in the 17th week of pregnancy! As you are currently in the second trimester, additional symptoms such as stretch marks and increased vaginal discharge have likely replaced the unpleasant early symptoms (such as acute tiredness and morning sickness).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Also, you might feel more of a desire for sex once your energy levels return. The increased blood flow to your pelvic area is the reason for this.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Unfortunately, for some, their spouses may be suffering from sympathetic pregnancy, also known as couvade syndrome. For example, they might feel the same symptoms you had at first, such as nausea, exhaustion, and trouble sleeping. These could all lessen their desire for sex.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>A good and close relationship depends on communication, even though it might sometimes be challenging. Your spouse will experience good days as well. Find common ground to ensure a happy pregnancy.</span><br /><br /></p> <h2><strong>Sleep Position</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>It's time to choose a new sleeping position: tummy sleepers. When you lie on your back, your uterus and growing baby press over the inferior vena cava, a large blood vessel. This may cause your blood pressure to drop and disrupt the baby's blood flow. It's recommended to sleep on the side.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>For maximum blood flow, it's advisable to start sleeping on your left side with a 17-week pregnant belly. (Actually, it's okay to lie in any posture other than flat on your back; if you sleep on your back, place a pillow under one hip and lean your abdomen to the side.)&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Emotionally Stable</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your hormones are still active during the second half of your pregnancy. Fortunately, you might not feel as ill or exhausted as you felt during the first few weeks. Your placenta will take over now that it is large enough, giving you more energy.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Many pregnant women claim that the second trimester is when they feel the happiest despite the fact that they are still very emotional. Positively, as you take joy in carrying children, this is an excellent way to increase your self-confidence.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Consume delicious and healthful food, get out occasionally, and shoot as many pictures as you can. You can also maintain a diary to have something to refer to later.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Nail and Hair Maintenance</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Aside from uncomfortable symptoms, one wonderful thing that many expecting mothers look forward to is having healthy hair and nails! Your hair feels thicker and has more shine now that the hormone (estrogen) is present in it.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Additionally, you might notice unexpected changes to your hair. It's weird but amazing to watch straight hair turn curly and wavy! Maybe this is the perfect chance to try out a new style.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Not only will your hair grow faster, but so will your nails. Now is probably the ideal time to hold off on applying too much nail paint because you might find it more fragile.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Try these pregnancy-approved nail care suggestions:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- moisturize your hands, including the fingernails;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- often trim your nails;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- and use a light nail strengthening cream.</span></p>"

Most women experience sour, sweet, salty, or spicy tastes.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>No matter what you are seeking, you should always eat a diet high in nutrients. Simple plants have a lot of nutritional value. You can effortlessly produce parsley, basil, and oregano while cooking your food by planting them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Avoid junk food and beverages that are high in empty calories, such as soda and chips. Just bake some vegetable chips or juice your favorite fruits to sate your hunger!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This week, you might still feel lightheaded despite having a greater hunger. This is because your heart and lungs pump more blood to meet your developing baby's needs.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Swollen Feet in Pregnancy</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>As early as 18 weeks, your feet might grow in addition to your tummy. Edema, or swelling, is essentially fluid retention and affects about 75% of pregnant women.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Because of this, your favorite shoes might no longer fit you. Is it really true? During the second half of their pregnancy, most women need larger shoes. It's also possible that wider, larger shoes fit you better after birth.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Try these tips to keep your feet in good condition</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- raise your feet as much as you can;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- place a pillow under your feet while you sleep;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- avoid standing for extended periods of time;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- massage and exercise your feet;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- wear maternity compression stockings to encourage circulation;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- and wear appropriate shoes with plenty of heel support.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Dos and Don&rsquo;t for 18 Week Pregnancy</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dos</strong></p> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Eat at least 2-4 servings of fruit daily, including pomegranate. (Pomegranate is rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C and iron, which will help prevent anemia.) Nonetheless, some studies warn that pomegranate seed extract can induce uterine contractions. Drinking the juice and eating the fruit is safe without the seed extract.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Drink enough water, as this will lessen your aches and cramps.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Keeping yourself safe and thinking good thoughts will help you overcome the pregnancy blues.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Get some exercise to help with the aches you will surely be experiencing.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Eat the right foods in sufficient quantities at the right times to keep your blood sugar levels in check.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>If you're feeling down or freaked out, seek support.&nbsp;</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Don't let your mood swings get the best of you, so surround yourself with positivity and brightness.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>Don'ts</strong></p> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Give up on maintaining proper personal hygiene because you are prone to diseases.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Put yourself in questionable situations.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Put out a lot of energy, especially when working out hard.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Put yourself under any kind of stress.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Use drugs or medicines that your doctor has not recommended.</span></li> </ul> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Pregnancy-related Vision Changes</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The numerous changes that occur in your body during pregnancy also affect your eyes. Your vision and eyeball shape could change. You may need to blink to focus. Your eyeballs will revert to their natural form after birth, so don't take stress just enjoy your pregnancy journey!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You might also suffer from dry eye syndrome. It occurs because estrogen makes your eyes less hydrated. To lubricate your eyes, you can use artificial tears over the counter. Wearing sunglasses is a good idea because sunlight may cause your eyes to become irritated.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your pregnancy is almost halfway over at week 18. While certain issues like swollen feet and sleepiness could arise, irritants like morning sickness should disappear. But, taking good care of yourself&mdash;that is, avoiding overdoing it and investing in comfy shoes&mdash;can greatly improve your mood. </span></p>"

      "<h2><strong>Maternity Application (Week 19) Mother</strong></h2> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Welcome to the Week 19</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>19 weeks are completed, amazing! You may have experienced a lot of pregnancy symptoms in these 19 weeks, right?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Now, everyone can see your growing baby bump, and you may occasionally experience lower stomach pain as it grows. These pains are normal so don't worry. They happen when your uterus's supporting tissues get stretched. It's common to have pain on one side of your body more frequently.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You may also notice many breast changes and darker nipples, which is also normal. Your areolas should naturally darken as more blood vessels nourish your breasts. They could also feel quite sensitive when they rub against your clothing or when you lie down on them to sleep.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Colostrum may also leak during this week. Colostrum is the first phase of breast milk, and it contains protein, sugar, and antibodies that are essential to your baby's growth and development.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Pregnancy causes the breasts to grow dramatically, which might cause the skin to become less hydrated. Stretch marks are frequently seen on the bottom of the breasts, where they initially appear.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>These modifications block the progesterone and estrogen receptors, which protect against cancer.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Feeling Round Ligament Pain?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>It is common to feel pain in the hip or stomach areas, whether on one or both sides. It might even extend to the pelvis or back.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The round ligament, which supports your uterus in the pelvic area, is the reason for this quick, acute pain. You experience pain because the round ligament stretches as your uterus expands during pregnancy. The worst times to experience this are when you cough or sneeze, as well as when you suddenly stand up.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Pain relief tips:&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- resting and lying down;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- shifting positions gradually;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- avoiding abrupt movements;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>- applying a specific bandage designed for pregnant women.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Mom-to-be, let's all giggle and not worry&mdash;pain in the round ligaments is common during pregnancy.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Start Skin Care&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The best moment to take care of your skin is now, if you haven't already considered it. Stretch marks and dryness, acne, and rashes are the most feared pregnancy side effects.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>To project the wonderful pregnant glow, follow these measures:</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Twice a day, apply essential oils to your arms, lower back, chest, thighs, and belly. It's been suggested that avocado, argan, and sunflower oils add moisture to the skin to help minimize or eliminate stretch marks.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Use products safe for pregnancy for skin care, tone, and moisturizer. Avoid synthetic chemicals and stick to skin-friendly brands.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Carefully read the product labels and ingredients list:</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Verify that no artificial chemicals, phthalates, or parabens are present in your skincare products. It is important to remember that pregnant women should not take certain anti-acne drugs, such as salicylic acid or isotretinoin.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Remain hydrated:</strong></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>To increase the flexibility of your skin, drink eight to ten glasses of water daily. Your skin will become dry and sagging from dehydration.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Diet Tips&nbsp;</strong></h2> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Add milk and egg to your diet (containing vitamin A). Baby development depends on vitamin A. Numerous organs, including the heart, lungs, brain, spinal cord, kidneys, bones, and eyes, benefit from its development.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The body produces Vitamin A using beta-carotene, a pigment found in plant-based foods such as spinach, carrots, pumpkin, cantaloupe, and other yellow fruits. While eating too many animal products can cause vitamin A overdose, beta-carotene from plant sources cannot be overdosed. Consuming beta-carotene from fruits and vegetables is far better.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Eat nuts and seeds with omega-3 fatty acids. These are also good for the baby&rsquo;s brain development.</span></li> </ul> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Care Tips for Week 19</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Undoubtedly, becoming pregnant is one of the most beautiful experiences in a woman's life. Taking all the necessary precautions to keep you and your little one safe becomes more important than ever. Maintaining physical and mental health during this time is the most important thing you can do to ensure a smooth birth of your child. Enjoy every moment with your partner, discuss everything with him, don't be stressed, and sleep well!</span></p>"

It might feel like time is crawling or flying quickly; it depends on how you're handling all the changes occurring in your life and around you. Suddenly, everything feels so real. A little boy or girl will visit you soon, so be ready!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You're almost halfway to giving birth, so your mood will definitely improve. The uterus transfers its immunity to the developing fetus.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You will have a noticeable pregnant belly. The fundal height, which extends from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus or fundus, will now be measured by your doctor or midwife (a person who assists women in childbirth).</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The centimeter measurement indicates your current progress. For example, you should be about 20 weeks pregnant if your fundal height is 20 cm (7.8 in). A healthy weight is a positive sign that your pregnancy is going well.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Preeclampsia's Risks</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Preeclampsia is one of the most frequent pregnancy problems, starting around 20 weeks. Kidney failure and hypertension are two signs of it. It may even impact people whose blood pressure was normal before their pregnancy.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Slowly developing hypertension, a strong headache, blurred vision, nausea, dyspnea, and hand and foot swelling are among the symptoms. Premature birth, bleeding, and premature delivery are other conditions that can result from preeclampsia and are all dangerous or even dangerous to the baby.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Preeclampsia is difficult to manage, but you can prevent symptoms from getting worse with regular medication, a well-controlled diet, enough sleep, and close gynecologist care. Thankfully, preeclampsia symptoms usually go away after birth.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Worried About Fat?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Many individuals believe that fats are bad in general. That is not entirely accurate, as fat helps transport vitamins and provides our bodies with energy.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Still, it's critical to understand the difference between good and bad fats.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The following foods include healthy fats: avocados, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oil.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>If you don't limit what you consume, unhealthy fats can cause heart disease and clog your arteries. These are frequently found in cakes, fries, butter, eggs, fatty meat, full-fat dairy products, and fried chicken.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Still, balance is essential. Avoiding harmful fats is advised, especially if you are already at risk for high blood pressure or diabetes.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Care Tips</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Here are a few things to do and a few to avoid during your 20th week of pregnancy:</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Dos</strong></p> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Try sleeping on your left side to prevent your baby from putting too much pressure on your artery. Sleeping on your left side will relieve pressure from your stomach and liver, allowing you to get a good night's rest.&nbsp;</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You can also sleep with three more pillows: one beneath your belly, one behind your back, and one between your legs. Pregnant ladies can even get pillows specifically made for them.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Wear comfy shoes with flat soles to prevent further discomfort from your swollen feet. Avoid shoes that are excessively tight or have high heels.&nbsp;</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>See a physiotherapist frequently. They can offer workout recommendations and support in managing severe pregnancy-related back, rib, or pelvic discomfort.&nbsp;</span></li> </ul> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><strong>Don&rsquo;ts</strong></p> <ul> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Do not sleep on your back because the baby presses against your backbone when you sleep like this, which can be painful.&nbsp;</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Avoid sleeping on the right side. You won't be able to feel the pressure on your liver if you sleep on your right side.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You should never have to carry large weights, but if you must, bend your knees.&nbsp;</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Avoid standing more on one leg than the other. Stand up straight by supporting your back with your abdominal muscles.</span></li> <li style='font-weight: 400;'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Try not to sit down without using a pad or cushion to support your back.</span></li> </ul> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>What to Shop?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>It's time to go shopping for baby carriers so you can carry your child. Additionally, it's a smart idea to start searching for fashionable maternity clothes that fit your growing figure. Maternity underwear that supports your lower back and stomach is a great option for easy daily dressing. Choose quality bras that include adjustable shoulder straps and comfy, flexible material.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><br /><strong>Mom, keep in mind one thing:</strong><span style='font-weight: 400;'> pregnancy doesn't have to be about the suffering and issues that come with it; with the correct planning and measures, it can be more about enjoying the near birth of the baby. So, gathering information or signing up for prenatal classes is a great way to learn how to care for your baby in your tummy.</span></h2>"

It's okay; your baby can only grab and release it at most.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>By now, your baby's taste buds have developed. An ultrasound scan will clarify that the skeleton is also growing into bones. The circulatory and urinary systems are two of the more sophisticated bodily systems that are now functional.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Baby's facial development is improving, too: eyes and ears are blinking and frowning. Even at week 16, your baby's skin is still extremely thin and nearly transparent. You might literally see the tiny, delicate blood vessels under the skin if you could take a closer look at your child right now.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>What else is your little one doing at 16 weeks?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The second trimester is when babies develop the most, and a 16-week fetus is no different. Now, your baby's important organs are developing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your baby has more lung tissue forming, its bones are starting to harden, its pancreas and liver are making, and even its toenails are growing. Lungs simply inhale and exhale amniotic fluid, not oxygen, when your baby practices breathing-like moments. Keep in mind that your baby receives nutrition and oxygen from you through the placenta and umbilical cord.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your baby's heart is still quite small, but it beats very well! The little heart in such a tiny person can continuously pump about 25 quarts of blood per day! Put simply, this is a big week for the baby!&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><br /><br /></h2> <h2><strong>Does your baby have taste buds?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Of course! Your baby's taste buds have developed by 16 weeks, and because the neurons have formed by 8 weeks, your little one is now sensitive to specific flavors.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>It may surprise you to know that the amniotic fluid has a flavor similar to food. Your baby can try many flavors, especially strong ones like curry and garlic. The amniotic fluid's flavor may also be sweet if you consume sugary foods.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>However, research indicates that most babies choose sweet flavors because this helps them grow to love breast milk. After giving birth and seeing your child grow, you could notice that your baby has already begun to show a preference for particular foods.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>One more interesting fact?</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>By week 16, the ear structures that control hearing are already well-formed, but they will continue to grow over the following few weeks.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>What... What does this mean? This week is the first time your baby will hear your voice! In fact, throughout the next few months, your voice will be the clearest sound your kid can hear. For now, your baby will be able to hear bodily sounds like air entering your lungs and your stomach gurgling.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This week's most exciting milestone might be your baby's ability to hear and know your voice from birth. So speak to your baby and allow dad to talk to your little one as well! You can also play a song for your baby at this stage, and you'll be shocked to learn that they know it from birth!&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>According to studies, a baby may hold the memory of a lullaby it heard in the womb. So, let's sing your baby a beautiful lullaby! Your newborn will be able to identify a well-known song and voice. </span></p>"

Your baby is gaining weight and developing muscle in those bones, which will help the baby's body perform essential tasks like temperature regulation and metabolism.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The vernix, a slick, white substance that works as a barrier that protects the skin from amniotic fluid, develops in the baby about this period.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The baby's ears have nearly reached their final position. Rather than on the sides, the eyes are now positioned forward. The majority of your baby's reactions, including the sucking and swallowing ones that will be useful after delivery, are fully formed by now!&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Baby&rsquo;s Adorable Facial Expressions</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This week, your baby should start to move their muscles more as the brain is now controlling their heart rate. At this point, your baby can play with their hands and bend and extend their limbs.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Now that the facial muscles are moving, your baby can express a wide range of facial emotions. However, he/she has no control over these expressions yet.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Now, your little one is practicing making facial expressions before birth, just like when a baby is practicing breathing movements before it can actually breathe.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Early Accumulation of Fat</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Developing body fat in the womb can benefit the developing baby by encouraging healthy brain development and lowering the likelihood of certain illnesses.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>While fat accumulates rapidly during the last trimester, early fat tissues start accumulating around week 17. These will make your little pear appear more like a baby! Early fat deposits help define your baby's fine features this week.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Remember that fats eventually replace lanugo in regulating the body's temperature, so early fat tissues are now beginning to play a crucial role.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Although the formation of fat may not be happening quickly now, it will happen shortly! </span></p>"

A lot! Now, your baby is exercising its muscles and learning how to do various actions. Is it really true that the baby is swallowing, sucking, hiccupping, and yawning? They're punching, kicking, twisting, rolling, and they're big enough that you might feel them doing it!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your baby is growing up so quickly! Your baby weighs roughly the same as a bell pepper right now. Your resident is now able to hear and feel! The movement of the baby's chest also resembles breathing, but the baby is simply consuming amniotic fluid, not air. Until delivery, your sweetie won't truly breathe in oxygen.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Gender of Your Baby</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This week, the development of other structures like the genitals, the myelin covering coating around the nerves, and fingerprints continues. This week, if you plan an ultrasound scan, you may be able to find out your baby's gender!&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>If you are having a girl, the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes are in place. If you're having a boy, the genitals are distinct and identifiable. We hope your baby doesn't try to hide them when you get an ultrasound!</span></p> <h2><br /><br /></h2> <h2><strong>Week 18th Nervous System</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Even though your baby's nervous system has been growing during the early stages of conception, this week marks a significant developmental milestone for this fascinating bodily system.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This is due to the beginning of myelin formation surrounding the nerves. This cover is essential for brain communication and shielding your baby's nerves. They also speed up the messages that are transmitted between neurons. Many birth defects may arise in the absence of myelin.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Up until the age of 12 months or so, myelin forms. Remember that the nervous system includes the five senses as well: taste, smell, hearing, touch, and sight. After birth, these senses continue to develop quickly.</span></p> <h2>&nbsp;</h2> <h2><strong>Yawning During this Time</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>What more moves can your tiny athlete perform? Leaps, thumbsucks, head turns, arm flexions, and knee twists. Your baby has picked up a new ability this week: yawning.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Yawning is a common behavior connected to fatigue, sleepiness, and lack of interest, although its exact meaning is unknown. Can your baby truly be bored in the womb? You should be shocked that your child now has this ability despite any doubts.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>If you're lucky, you might capture your baby yawning during your ultrasound scan once more. What a comforting sight that is. Remember to request a picture!</span></p>"

As expected, lots of changes are taking place now!</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Vernix caseosa, a gooey layer shielding skin from amniotic fluid, has completely covered your baby. If you notice this from birth, don't worry&mdash;it won't last very long.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>This week also marks the beginning of sensory development. The five senses&mdash;taste, smell, sight, hearing, and touch&mdash;are developing in separate brain regions. Neuron development slows down during this time, but connections become deeper.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>The kidneys in your baby still produce urine. The girl or boy you are carrying already has about six million eggs in her ovaries, but this is decreasing. Your baby will have roughly a million eggs when he/she is born.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><br /><br /></h2> <h2><strong>Vernix Cover Your Baby</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You've heard a lot about the silly material that covers your child. The kind of plant known as vernix caseosa.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>It is understandable why vernix appears white, feels oily, and seems fairly disagreeable, as it is a combination of dead skin cells, oil from your baby's glands, and the soft, downy hair known as lanugo.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>But it's not as ugly as you would think&mdash;especially when you consider the advantages it offers your child. Vernix is at its thickest during week 19, so you might wish to read up on its significance.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Your baby's delicate skin is shielded by the waxy layer, especially if not much fat has yet developed. While the amniotic fluid cushions your baby, the vernix keeps them from appearing overly wrinkly.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>It's common to observe some vernix after giving birth to your child. This lets you see it up close and personal, but don't worry&mdash;it will go soon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Baby Movement at Week 19</strong></h2> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>For any expecting mother, the second trimester&mdash;actually the entire pregnancy&mdash;is a magical period. This week, especially when the movements are obvious, is significant because it's the first time that the thought of having a baby soon starts to kick in.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>You will have begun to feel your baby move at 19 weeks. Most expectant mothers begin to feel movement between weeks 18 and 20. If you've previously been pregnant, you'll experience symptoms sooner rather than later.</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Note your initial feelings about your baby and share them with a doctor. This is a crucial part of the prenatal checkup process. You will start to experience more regular movements as your pregnancy goes on! </span></p>"
